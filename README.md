# Census Data 
This project is a quick start for anyone looking to build on a data science program. Census data is notoriously extensive and clean from an analysis standpoint. The main point of this project is to make the census api calls more user friendly

## Getting Started
You will need to create a key via this link to request an [api key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html "census api key"). Then just place and name it in an appropriate .env file. Naming convention is CENSUS_API_KEY.

## Navigating Files
You can collect data using census_api. The prefered method is likely to import the functions into another file and writing some logic to automate the collection process based on your needs. If you only want to complete a few queries you can just run the file locally. The main file in this repository just has some simple examples of using and displaying data.

## Unittest
You can run the unit test from command line or any other common methods. Main testing is performed on 

## Future
This project was built quickly (1 day) for the purposes of playing with datasets. I think making a nice UI would be a logical next step. Another obvious step would be to add a ML module to this project.
